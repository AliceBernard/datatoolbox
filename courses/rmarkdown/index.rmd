## Introduction




---
## Why you should not use Word (or other WYSIWYG editors)

** Demo **
- Create a document with Word
- Put the file under versioning
- Update the file and commit
- Perform a regression model using the `iris` dataset (available in `MASS`)
---
## What we need
- Something that can be easily used in versioning tools
- Something able to integrate text and analysis
- Something that is dynamic

---
## Literate Programming

- Text in human language (English)
- Code snippet (separated by a primitive markup) included (chunk)
- Text and code are compiled to produce the final document (tangle, sweave)

<br>
In R

- Sweave (.Rnw) = Latex and R -> .pdf 
- Rmarkdown (.Rmd) = Mardown and R -> .pdf, .html, etc. (package `rmarkdown`)

<br>
** Demo **
- create a new Rmd file with RStudio
- Identify the three parts

---
class: inverse, center, middle
## The YAML metadata
---
## YAML in brief

- It contains the metadta of the document
- It contains also options for pandoc
- It starts and ends by three dashes
- Located at the first line of the document
---
## Some examples
```{md}
---
output:
    pdf_document:
        toc: true
        number_sections: true
        toc_depth: 2
  
    html_document:
        toc: true
        toc_float: true
        code_folding: hide
        css: mystyle.css
---
```

```{md}
---
abstract: "The abstract of the document is located here"
bibliography: myrefs.bib
csl: mystyle.csl
---
```
---
class: inverse, center, middle
## The R code
---
## Three alternatives
- inline by
```{md}
`rmarkdown`
```
- inline evaluated by
```{md}
`r pi`
```
- bloc (with different available options)
  - echo
  - eval
  - cache
  - results
  - etc

## The text
---
## Format your text

```{md}
**bold**
_italics_

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

^superscript^
~subscript~
- Item 1
  - Sub-Item 1

1. Numbered Item
  1. Numbered sub-Item
  
[link](www.lequipe.fr)
![title](path/to/image)

$$ \sum_{i = 1}^n x_i $$ 

```

- Indent by a tab of 4 spaces
- Use a blank line to start a new paragraph
---
## Tables
```{md}
| header A | header B |
|---------:|:---------|
| data     | data     |

Table:title

```

---
## Managing the bibliography

- Use BiBTex to manage the bibliography
- Define a CSL to format the bibliography
- Cite by `[@key]` or `@key` (separate multiple refs by `;`)
- Add `# References` at the end of the document
